* 2.2.4 (in-development)
    * WARNING: Potential backwards incompatible change - Changed order of
      parameters of ZREVRANGEBYSCORE to match those of the actual Redis command.
      This is only backwards-incompatible if you were passing max and min via
      keyword args. If passing by normal args, nothing in user code should have
      to change. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
    * Fixed INFO to properly parse the Redis data correctly for both 2.2.x and
      2.3+. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
    * Lock objects now store their timeout value as a float. This allows floats
      to be used as timeout values. No changes to existing code required.
    * WATCH now supports multiple keys. Thanks Rich Schumacher.
    * Broke out some code that was Python 2.4 incompatible. redis-py should
      now be useable on 2.4, but this hasn't actually been tested. Thanks
      Dan Colish for the patch.
    * Optimized some code using izip and islice. Should have a pretty good
      speed up on larger data sets. Thanks Dan Colish.
    * Better error handling when submitting an empty mapping to HMSET. Thanks
      Dan Colish.
    * Subscription status is now reset after every (re)connection.
* 2.2.3
    * Added support for Hiredis. To use, simply "pip install hiredis" or
      "easy_install hiredis". Thanks for Pieter Noordhuis for the hiredis-py
      bindings and the patch to redis-py.
    * The connection class is chosen based on whether hiredis is installed
      or not. To force the use of the PythonConnection, simply create
      your own ConnectionPool instance with the connection_class argument
      assigned to to PythonConnection class.
    * Added missing command ZREVRANGEBYSCORE. Thanks Jay Baird for the patch.
    * The INFO command should be parsed correctly on 2.2.x server versions
      and is backwards compatible with older versions. Thanks Brett Hoerner.
* 2.2.2
    * Fixed a bug in ZREVRANK where retriving the rank of a value not in
      the zset would raise an error.
    * Fixed a bug in Connection.send where the errno import was getting
      overwritten by a local variable.
    * Fixed a bug in SLAVEOF when promoting an existing slave to a master.
    * Reverted change of download URL back to redis-VERSION.tar.gz. 2.2.1's
      change of this actually broke Pypi for Pip installs. Sorry!
* 2.2.1
    * Changed archive name to redis-py-VERSION.tar.gz to not conflict
      with the Redis server archive.
* 2.2.0
    * Implemented SLAVEOF
    * Implemented CONFIG as config_get and config_set
    * Implemented GETBIT/SETBIT
    * Implemented BRPOPLPUSH
    * Implemented STRLEN
    * Implemented PERSIST
    * Implemented SETRANGE
