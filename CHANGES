* 2.6.3 (in development)
    * Added BITOP and BITCOUNT commands. Thanks Mark Tozzi.
    * Added the TIME command. Thanks Jason Knight.
* 2.6.2
    * `from_url` is now available as a classmethod on client classes. Thanks
      Jon Parise for the patch.
    * Fixed several encoding errors resulting from the Python 3.x support.
* 2.6.1
    * Python 3.x support! Big thanks to Alex Grönholm.
    * Fixed a bug in the PythonParser's read_response that could hide an error
      from the client (#251).
* 2.6.0
    * Changed (p)subscribe and (p)unsubscribe to no longer return messages
      indicating the channel was subscribed/unsubscribed to. These messages
      are available in the listen() loop instead. This is to prevent the
      following scenario:
        * Client A is subscribed to "foo"
        * Client B publishes message to "foo"
        * Client A subscribes to channel "bar" at the same time.
      Prior to this change, the subscribe() call would return the published
      messages on "foo" rather than the subscription confirmation to "bar".
    * Added support for GETRANGE, thanks Jean-Philippe Caruana
    * A new setting "decode_responses" specifies whether return values from
      Redis commands get decoded automatically using the client's charset
      value. Thanks to Frankie Dintino for the patch.
* 2.4.13
    * redis.from_url() can take an URL representing a Redis connection string
      and return a client object. Thanks Kenneth Reitz for the patch.
* 2.4.12
    * ConnectionPool is now fork-safe. Thanks Josiah Carson for the patch.
* 2.4.11
    * AuthenticationError will now be correctly raised if an invalid password
      is supplied.
    * If Hiredis is unavailable, the HiredisParser will raise a RedisError
      if selected manually.
    * Made the INFO command more tolerant of Redis changes formatting. Fix
      for #217.
* 2.4.10
    * Buffer reads from socket in the PythonParser. Fix for a Windows-specific
      bug (#205).
    * Added the OBJECT and DEBUG OBJECT commands.
    * Added __del__ methods for classes that hold on to resources that need to
      be cleaned up. This should prevent resource leakage when these objects
      leave scope due to misuse or unhandled exceptions. Thanks David Wolever
      for the suggestion.
    * Added the ECHO command for completeness.
    * Fixed a bug where attempting to subscribe to a PubSub channel of a Redis
      server that's down would blow out the stack. Fixes #179 and #195. Thanks
      Ovidiu Predescu for the test case.
    * StrictRedis's TTL command now returns a -1 when querying a key with no
      expiration. The Redis class continues to return None.
    * ZADD and SADD now return integer values indicating the number of items
      added. Thanks Homer Strong.
    * Renamed the base client class to StrictRedis, replacing ZADD and LREM in
      favor of their official argument order. The Redis class is now a subclass
      of StrictRedis, implementing the legacy redis-py implementations of ZADD
      and LREM. Docs have been updated to suggesting the use of StrictRedis.
    * SETEX in StrictRedis is now compliant with official Redis SETEX command.
      the name, value, time implementation moved to "Redis" for backwards
      compatability.
* 2.4.9
    * Removed socket retry logic in Connection. This is the responsbility of
      the caller to determine if the command is safe and can be retried. Thanks
      David Wolver.
    * Added some extra guards around various types of exceptions being raised
      when sending or parsing data. Thanks David Wolver and Denis Bilenko.
* 2.4.8
    * Imported with_statement from __future__ for Python 2.5 compatability.
* 2.4.7
    * Fixed a bug where some connections were not getting released back to the
      connection pool after pipeline execution.
    * Pipelines can now be used as context managers. This is the preferred way
      of use to ensure that connections get cleaned up properly. Thanks
      David Wolever.
    * Added a convenience method called transaction() on the base Redis class.
      This method eliminates much of the boilerplate used when using pipelines
      to watch Redis keys. See the documentation for details on usage.
* 2.4.6
    * Variadic arguments for SADD, SREM, ZREN, HDEL, LPUSH, and RPUSH. Thanks
      Raphaël Vinot.
    * (CRITICAL) Fixed an error in the Hiredis parser that occasionally caused
      the socket connection to become corrupted and unusable. This became
      noticeable once connection pools started to be used.
    * ZRANGE, ZREVRANGE, ZRANGEBYSCORE, and ZREVRANGEBYSCORE now take an
      additional optional argument, score_cast_func, which is a callable used
      to cast the score value in the return type. The default is float.
    * Removed the PUBLISH method from the PubSub class. Connections that are
      [P]SUBSCRIBEd cannot issue PUBLISH commands, so it doesn't make sense
      to have it here.
    * Pipelines now contain WATCH and UNWATCH. Calling WATCH or UNWATCH from
      the base client class will result in a deprecation warning. After
      WATCHing one or more keys, the pipeline will be placed in immediate
      execution mode until UNWATCH or MULTI are called. Refer to the new
      pipeline docs in the README for more information. Thanks to David Wolever
      and Randall Leeds for greatly helping with this.
* 2.4.5
    * The PythonParser now works better when reading zero length strings.
* 2.4.4
    * Fixed a typo introduced in 2.4.3
* 2.4.3
    * Fixed a bug in the UnixDomainSocketConnection caused when trying to
      form an error message after a socket error.
* 2.4.2
    * Fixed a bug in pipeline that caused an exception while trying to
      reconnect after a connection timeout.
* 2.4.1
    * Fixed a bug in the PythonParser if disconnect is called before connect.
* 2.4.0
    * WARNING: 2.4 contains several backwards incompatible changes.
    * Completely refactored Connection objects. Moved much of the Redis
      protocol packing for requests here, and eliminated the nasty dependencies
      it had on the client to do AUTH and SELECT commands on connect.
    * Connection objects now have a parser attribute. Parsers are responsible
      for reading data Redis sends. Two parsers ship with redis-py: a
      PythonParser and the HiRedis parser. redis-py will automatically use the
      HiRedis parser if you have the Python hiredis module installed, otherwise
      it will fall back to the PythonParser. You can force or the other, or even
      an external one by passing the `parser_class` argument to ConnectionPool.
    * Added a UnixDomainSocketConnection for users wanting to talk to the Redis
      instance running on a local machine only. You can use this connection
      by passing it to the `connection_class` argument of the ConnectionPool.
    * Connections no longer derive from threading.local. See threading.local
      note below.
    * ConnectionPool has been comletely refactored. The ConnectionPool now
      maintains a list of connections. The redis-py client only hangs on to
      a ConnectionPool instance, calling get_connection() anytime it needs to
      send a command. When get_connection() is called, the command name and
      any keys involved in the command are passed as arguments. Subclasses of
      ConnectionPool could use this information to identify the shard the keys
      belong to and return a connection to it. ConnectionPool also implements
      disconnect() to force all connections in the pool to disconnect from
      the Redis server.
    * redis-py no longer support the SELECT command. You can still connect to
      a specific database by specifing it when instantiating a client instance
      or by creating a connection pool. If you need to talk to multiplate
      databases within your application, you should use a separate client
      instance for each database you want to talk to.
    * Completely refactored Publish/Subscribe support. The subscribe and listen
      commands are no longer available on the redis-py Client class. Instead,
      the `pubsub` method returns an instance of the PubSub class which contains
      all publish/subscribe support. Note, you can still PUBLISH from the
      redis-py client class if you desire.
    * Removed support for all previously deprecated commands or options.
    * redis-py no longer uses threading.local in any way. Since the Client
      class no longer holds on to a connection, it's no longer needed. You can
      now pass client instances between threads, and commands run on those
      threads will retrieve an available connection from the pool, use it and
      release it. It should now be trivial to use redis-py with eventlet or
      greenlet.
    * ZADD now accepts pairs of value=score keyword arguements. This should help
      resolve the long standing #72. The older value and score arguements have
      been deprecated in favor of the keyword argument style.
    * Client instances now get their own copy of RESPONSE_CALLBACKS. The new
      set_response_callback method adds a user defined callback to the instance.
    * Support Jython, fixing #97. Thanks to Adam Vandenberg for the patch.
    * Using __getitem__ now properly raises a KeyError when the key is not
      found. Thanks Ionuț Arțăriși for the patch.
    * Newer Redis versions return a LOADING message for some commands while
      the database is loading from disk during server start. This could cause
      problems with SELECT. We now force a socket disconnection prior to
      raising a ResponseError so subsuquent connections have to reconnect and
      re-select the appropriate database. Thanks to Benjamin Anderson for
      finding this and fixing.
* 2.2.4
    * WARNING: Potential backwards incompatible change - Changed order of
      parameters of ZREVRANGEBYSCORE to match those of the actual Redis command.
      This is only backwards-incompatible if you were passing max and min via
      keyword args. If passing by normal args, nothing in user code should have
      to change. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
    * Fixed INFO to properly parse the Redis data correctly for both 2.2.x and
      2.3+. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
    * Lock objects now store their timeout value as a float. This allows floats
      to be used as timeout values. No changes to existing code required.
    * WATCH now supports multiple keys. Thanks Rich Schumacher.
    * Broke out some code that was Python 2.4 incompatible. redis-py should
      now be useable on 2.4, but this hasn't actually been tested. Thanks
      Dan Colish for the patch.
    * Optimized some code using izip and islice. Should have a pretty good
      speed up on larger data sets. Thanks Dan Colish.
    * Better error handling when submitting an empty mapping to HMSET. Thanks
      Dan Colish.
    * Subscription status is now reset after every (re)connection.
* 2.2.3
    * Added support for Hiredis. To use, simply "pip install hiredis" or
      "easy_install hiredis". Thanks for Pieter Noordhuis for the hiredis-py
      bindings and the patch to redis-py.
    * The connection class is chosen based on whether hiredis is installed
      or not. To force the use of the PythonConnection, simply create
      your own ConnectionPool instance with the connection_class argument
      assigned to to PythonConnection class.
    * Added missing command ZREVRANGEBYSCORE. Thanks Jay Baird for the patch.
    * The INFO command should be parsed correctly on 2.2.x server versions
      and is backwards compatible with older versions. Thanks Brett Hoerner.
* 2.2.2
    * Fixed a bug in ZREVRANK where retriving the rank of a value not in
      the zset would raise an error.
    * Fixed a bug in Connection.send where the errno import was getting
      overwritten by a local variable.
    * Fixed a bug in SLAVEOF when promoting an existing slave to a master.
    * Reverted change of download URL back to redis-VERSION.tar.gz. 2.2.1's
      change of this actually broke Pypi for Pip installs. Sorry!
* 2.2.1
    * Changed archive name to redis-py-VERSION.tar.gz to not conflict
      with the Redis server archive.
* 2.2.0
    * Implemented SLAVEOF
    * Implemented CONFIG as config_get and config_set
    * Implemented GETBIT/SETBIT
    * Implemented BRPOPLPUSH
    * Implemented STRLEN
    * Implemented PERSIST
    * Implemented SETRANGE
