* 2.4 (in development)
    * WARNING: 2.4 contains several backwards incompatible changes.
    * Completely refactored Connection objects. Moved much of the Redis
      protocol packing for requests here, and eliminated the nasty dependencies
      it had on the client to do AUTH and SELECT commands on connect.
    * Connection objects now have a parser attribute. Parsers are responsible
      for reading data Redis sends. Two parsers ship with redis-py: a
      PythonParser and the HiRedis parser. redis-py will automatically use the
      HiRedis parser if you have the Python hiredis module installed, otherwise
      it will fall back to the PythonParser. You can force or the other, or even
      an external one by passing the `parser_class` argument to ConnectionPool.
    * Added a UnixDomainSocketConnection for users wanting to talk to the Redis
      instance running on a local machine only. You can use this connection
      by passing it to the `connection_class` argument of the ConnectionPool.
    * Connections no longer derive from threading.local. See threading.local
      note below.
    * ConnectionPool has been comletely refactored. The ConnectionPool now
      maintains a list of connections. The redis-py client only hangs on to
      a ConnectionPool instance, calling get_connection() anytime it needs to
      send a command. When get_connection() is called, the command name and
      any keys involved in the command are passed as arguments. Subclasses of
      ConnectionPool could use this information to identify the shard the keys
      belong to and return a connection to it. ConnectionPool also implements
      disconnect() to force all connections in the pool to disconnect from
      the Redis server.
    * redis-py no longer support the SELECT command. You can still connect to
      a specific database by specifing it when instantiating a client instance
      or by creating a connection pool. If you need to talk to multiplate
      databases within your application, you should use a separate client
      instance for each database you want to talk to.
    * Completely refactored Publish/Subscribe support. The subscribe and listen
      commands are no longer available on the redis-py Client class. Instead,
      the `pubsub` method returns an instance of the PubSub class which contains
      all publish/subscribe support. Note, you can still PUBLISH from the
      redis-py client class if you desire.
    * Removed support for all previously deprecated commands or options.
    * redis-py no longer uses threading.local in any way. Since the Client
      class no longer holds on to a connection, it's no longer needed. You can
      now pass client instances between threads, and commands run on those
      threads will retrieve an available connection from the pool, use it and
      release it. It should now be trivial to use redis-py with eventlet or
      greenlet.
    * Support Jython, fixing #97. Thanks to Adam Vandenberg for the patch.
    * Using __getitem__ now properly raises a KeyError when the key is not
      found. Thanks Ionuț Arțăriși for the patch.
    * Newer Redis versions return a LOADING message for some commands while
      the database is loading from disk during server start. This could cause
      problems with SELECT. We now force a socket disconnection prior to
      raising a ResponseError so subsuquent connections have to reconnect and
      re-select the appropriate database. Thanks to Benjamin Anderson for
      finding this and fixing.
* 2.2.4
    * WARNING: Potential backwards incompatible change - Changed order of
      parameters of ZREVRANGEBYSCORE to match those of the actual Redis command.
      This is only backwards-incompatible if you were passing max and min via
      keyword args. If passing by normal args, nothing in user code should have
      to change. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
    * Fixed INFO to properly parse the Redis data correctly for both 2.2.x and
      2.3+. Thanks Stéphane Angel for the fix.
    * Lock objects now store their timeout value as a float. This allows floats
      to be used as timeout values. No changes to existing code required.
    * WATCH now supports multiple keys. Thanks Rich Schumacher.
    * Broke out some code that was Python 2.4 incompatible. redis-py should
      now be useable on 2.4, but this hasn't actually been tested. Thanks
      Dan Colish for the patch.
    * Optimized some code using izip and islice. Should have a pretty good
      speed up on larger data sets. Thanks Dan Colish.
    * Better error handling when submitting an empty mapping to HMSET. Thanks
      Dan Colish.
    * Subscription status is now reset after every (re)connection.
* 2.2.3
    * Added support for Hiredis. To use, simply "pip install hiredis" or
      "easy_install hiredis". Thanks for Pieter Noordhuis for the hiredis-py
      bindings and the patch to redis-py.
    * The connection class is chosen based on whether hiredis is installed
      or not. To force the use of the PythonConnection, simply create
      your own ConnectionPool instance with the connection_class argument
      assigned to to PythonConnection class.
    * Added missing command ZREVRANGEBYSCORE. Thanks Jay Baird for the patch.
    * The INFO command should be parsed correctly on 2.2.x server versions
      and is backwards compatible with older versions. Thanks Brett Hoerner.
* 2.2.2
    * Fixed a bug in ZREVRANK where retriving the rank of a value not in
      the zset would raise an error.
    * Fixed a bug in Connection.send where the errno import was getting
      overwritten by a local variable.
    * Fixed a bug in SLAVEOF when promoting an existing slave to a master.
    * Reverted change of download URL back to redis-VERSION.tar.gz. 2.2.1's
      change of this actually broke Pypi for Pip installs. Sorry!
* 2.2.1
    * Changed archive name to redis-py-VERSION.tar.gz to not conflict
      with the Redis server archive.
* 2.2.0
    * Implemented SLAVEOF
    * Implemented CONFIG as config_get and config_set
    * Implemented GETBIT/SETBIT
    * Implemented BRPOPLPUSH
    * Implemented STRLEN
    * Implemented PERSIST
    * Implemented SETRANGE
