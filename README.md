\# Redis Sentinel Master Auto-Update Problem



This problem evaluates the ability to design a real-world engineering challenge based on an actively used open-source repository.



\## Why This Problem

Redis Sentinel failovers are common in production systems. Ensuring that clients immediately follow the active master without relying on retry-based discovery reflects realistic distributed systems behavior.



The problem focuses on correctness, determinism, and architectural alignment rather than implementation shortcuts.



\## Difficulty Justification

Difficulty is classified as \*\*Medium\*\* because:

\- The scope is limited to Sentinel-related behavior

\- Requires understanding of Redis client lifecycle

\- Involves state consistency across existing objects

\- Does not require system-wide refactoring



The task is solvable within 1.5–4 hours by an experienced engineer.
