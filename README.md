redis-py
========

This is the Python interface to the Redis key-value store.


Usage
-----

    >>> import redis
    >>> r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
    >>> r.set('foo', 'bar')   # or r['foo'] = 'bar'
    True
    >>> r.get('foo')   # or r['foo']
    'bar'

For a complete list of commands, check out the list of Redis commands here:
http://redis.io/commands

Installation
------------
    $ sudo pip install redis

alternatively:

    $ sudo easy_install redis

From sources:

    $ sudo python setup.py install

Versioning scheme
-----------------

redis-py is versioned after Redis. So, for example, redis-py 2.0.0 should 
support all the commands available in Redis 2.0.0. 

API Reference
-------------

### append(self, key, value)
  Appends the string _value_ to the value at _key_. If _key_
  doesn't already exist, create it with a value of _value_.
  Returns the new length of the value at _key_.

### bgrewriteaof(self)
  Tell the Redis server to rewrite the AOF file from data in memory.

### bgsave(self)
  Tell the Redis server to save its data to disk.  Unlike save(),
  this method is asynchronous and returns immediately.

### blpop(self, keys, timeout=0)
  LPOP a value off of the first non-empty list
  named in the _keys_ list.
  
  If none of the lists in _keys_ has a value to LPOP, then block
  for _timeout_ seconds, or until a value gets pushed on to one
  of the lists.
  
  If timeout is 0, then block indefinitely.

### brpop(self, keys, timeout=0)
  RPOP a value off of the first non-empty list
  named in the _keys_ list.
  
  If none of the lists in _keys_ has a value to LPOP, then block
  for _timeout_ seconds, or until a value gets pushed on to one
  of the lists.
  
  If timeout is 0, then block indefinitely.

### dbsize(self)
  Returns the number of keys in the current database

### decr(self, name, amount=1)
  Decrements the value of _key_ by _amount_.  If no key exists,
  the value will be initialized as 0 - _amount_

  Ping the Redis server

### pipeline(self, transaction=True)
  Return a new pipeline object that can queue multiple commands for
  later execution. _transaction_ indicates whether all commands

  pipelines are useful for batch loading of data as they reduce the
  number of back and forth network operations between client and server.
