# =====================================================================================
# DEPRECATED - DO NOT USE, DO NOT EDIT, DO NOT ADD TO.
#
# Nothing in this library reads this table. It is a frozen verbatim copy of the table that
# shipped in 7.1.0, kept only so that an external caller importing ``STATIC_POLICIES`` keeps
# working, and it will be removed in a future release. It is bound to a private name and
# served through the module ``__getattr__`` below, so that reading it warns.
#
# It is deliberately NOT derived from ``redis.commands.metadata._STATIC_COMMAND_METADATA`` and
# NOT kept in sync with it: the metadata table is the single source of truth, and
# ``StaticPolicyResolver`` resolves it through ``StaticMetadataResolver``, projecting one record
# at a time. Deriving this table instead would build ~100 throwaway objects on every import of
# ``redis`` for a table no code path consumes, and would silently change what an existing caller
# reads. So expect the two to disagree: this one answers "what did 7.1.0 route by", the metadata
# table answers "what does this client route by".
#
# To change routing, edit ``_STATIC_COMMAND_METADATA``. Nothing here.
# =====================================================================================
#
# Declared without a value so that linters and type checkers see the name that ``__all__``
# exports while the module ``__getattr__`` still serves it: an annotation alone binds nothing
# at runtime, whereas assigning here would bypass the deprecation warning.
