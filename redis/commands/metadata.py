"""
Normalized Redis command metadata.

This module owns the record types for everything the client derives from a ``COMMAND``
reply. ``CommandPolicies`` carries the request/response policies used for cluster routing;
``CommandMetadata`` is the superset record that adds the inputs to the
client-side-caching (CSC) eligibility rules.

A command is cacheable only when it is ``readonly``, is not ``blocking``, takes at least one
key name argument, and carries none of the ``nondeterministic_output``, ``script_runner`` or
``dont_cache`` markers - see :func:`_is_client_side_cacheable`, which is the one normative
implementation of those rules and also requires the source metadata to have been complete.
Every boolean below therefore defaults to the fail-closed value, so a partially populated
record is never mistaken for a cacheable one.

``MetadataResolver`` serves those records by command name. Resolvers chain through
``with_fallback``, first match wins, and an exhausted chain resolves to None - so an
unknown command fails closed. A cluster client reads the routing policies off the resolved
record; a client-side cache asks ``is_cacheable``, which applies the rules above to it. Either
way a consumer needs a reference to nothing but the resolver.

A record may also withhold its routing policies by leaving them None, which says that the
metadata does not describe how to route the command and the client must resolve the target
itself - see :func:`_to_command_policies`. The cacheability inputs of such a record are still
authoritative, so withholding routing costs nothing on the caching side.

``_STATIC_COMMAND_METADATA`` is the static resolver table, and the single source of truth for
what this client routes by: the commands eligible for client-side caching plus the commands the
7.1.0 ``redis.commands.policies.STATIC_POLICIES`` table carried. That table is now a frozen,
unread copy of its 7.1.0 self - edit routing here, never there. Values here are validated
against a live
``COMMAND`` reply - see the provenance note on the constant, which records the server it
was checked against and the entries that diverge on purpose, before editing it by hand.

class CommandMetadata:
    """
    Normalized metadata for a single Redis command or container subcommand.

    Instances are immutable so the static table below can be shared without copying. A
    resolver that refines a record builds a new one with :func:`dataclasses.replace`.

    Attributes:
        request_policy:
            How the cluster client should route the command. Derived from the
            ``request_policy`` command tip, defaulting to keyed/keyless based on whether
            the command takes keys. None means the record withholds its routing opinion:
            the metadata does not describe how to route this command, so the client resolves
            the target itself. That is distinct from ``DEFAULT_KEYLESS``, which is a routing
            decision - send the command to any one node.
        response_policy:
            How the cluster client should aggregate replies from several nodes. Derived
            from the ``response_policy`` command tip, with the same default. None has the
            same meaning as it does for ``request_policy``; the two are withheld together,
            because a policy resolver serves them as one record.
        is_readonly:
            Whether the command has the ``readonly`` command flag. Required for
            cacheability.
        is_blocking:
            Whether the command has the ``blocking`` command flag, which marks a command
            that may block the connection until data arrives. A blocking read serves the
            reply its caller waited for rather than a snapshot of keyspace state, so
            re-serving it from a cache would break the command's execution-time contract:
            ``XREAD BLOCK`` in a loop would stop blocking once a timed-out reply was cached.
            The exclusion is by command name, so ``XREAD`` is ineligible even when a
            particular call omits ``BLOCK``. It is the only readonly, keyed command the flag
            excludes.
        has_key_argument:
            Whether the command accepts at least one Redis key name argument. True when
            ``key_specifications`` holds at least one spec not flagged ``not_key``,
            falling back to ``first_key_pos > 0 and step_count > 0`` when key specs are
            absent. ``last_key_pos`` is never consulted: it is ``-1`` for variadic
            commands and must not disqualify one.

            This is not the inverse of ``_is_keyless_command``, which tests
            ``first_key_pos`` alone and so reports every ``movablekeys`` command as
            keyless. It is also recorded independently of ``request_policy``, because a
            command tip overwrites the keyed/keyless default, after which the resolved
            policy no longer indicates whether the command takes keys.
        has_nondeterministic_output:
            Whether the command has the ``nondeterministic_output`` command tip, which
            marks a command whose reply may differ between calls over the same keyspace
            state. Matched exactly rather than by prefix: ``nondeterministic_output_order``
            is a distinct tip, denoting only that element order varies.
        is_script_runner:
            Whether the command has the ``script_runner`` command flag, which marks a
            command that executes a user-supplied script or function. Reported by Redis
            8.10 and later; earlier servers do not report the flag at all.
        is_dont_cache:
            Whether the command has the ``dont_cache`` command tip, which marks a command
            whose reply the server states must not be cached client-side. It is a negative
            override: it decides on its own, even when every positive rule matches.
        has_complete_metadata:
            Whether the source metadata was complete enough to trust, meaning the command
            flags were present *and* the ``tips`` key was present. ``COMMAND`` replies
            older than Redis 7.0 carry neither ``tips`` nor ``key_specifications``, which
            makes ``nondeterministic_output`` and ``dont_cache`` undetectable. An empty
            tips list is a real answer; a missing tips key is not. An incomplete record
            must not be treated as authoritative.

# Static command metadata table
# =============================================================================
# This table is seeded from old ``CacheConfig.DEFAULT_ALLOW_LIST`` and ``redis.commands.policies.STATIC_POLICIES``.
#
# Every entry below was validated against a live ``COMMAND`` reply from Redis 8.10.0 with
# search, timeseries, ReJSON, bf and vectorset loaded (the ``redislabs/client-libs-test``
# stack image).
#
# The table is not exhaustive: the server reports 127 cacheable commands and this covers
# 73 of them. The uncovered ones are whole module surfaces the CSC allow-list never
# carried - ``bf.*``, ``cf.*``, ``cms.*``, ``topk.*``, ``tdigest.*``, the vectorset reads
# - plus core reads such as ``pfcount``, ``sdiffcard``, ``sunioncard`` and the
# ``*expiretime`` family. A command absent from the table fails closed, so the uncovered
# ones are simply not cached until either they are added or a live resolver is chained
# behind this one.
#
# The table records metadata; it is not an allow-list. ``xpending``, ``ts.info``, ``xread``,
# ``touch``, ``vrandmember`` and the three read-only script runners are present with the
# metadata that makes them *ineligible*, so the reason is documented in one place rather than
# inferred from an absence - and, because a resolver answers from the first record it finds,
# so that a live resolver chained behind this one cannot re-admit them. ``xpending``,
# ``ts.info`` and ``xread`` are on today's ``CacheConfig.DEFAULT_ALLOW_LIST``, and the server
# confirms all three are defects in that list: ``xpending`` is tipped
# ``nondeterministic_output``, ``ts.info`` ``dont_cache``, and ``xread`` carries the
# ``blocking`` command flag.
#
# Five entries diverge from the live reply, each for a reason spelled out where it occurs:
# ``exists`` and ``mget`` stand in the keyed defaults for the unimplemented ``multi_shard``
# tips, ``ft.cursor`` is SPECIAL, a client-side decision the server does not tip, ``touch`` is
# recorded ``dont_cache`` where the server reports it cacheable, and ``vrandmember`` is
# recorded ``nondeterministic_output`` where the server tips it nothing. The ``movablekeys``
# reads - ``eval_ro``, ``evalsha_ro``, ``fcall_ro``, ``sintercard``, ``xread``, ``zdiff``,
# ``zinter``, ``zintercard`` and ``zunion`` - plus ``touch`` and ``vrandmember`` withhold
# their routing policies entirely, so the cluster client keeps resolving their keys itself.
# Their cacheability inputs are unaffected.
