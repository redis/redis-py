"""Integration tests for the HIMPORT command family against a real server.

Runs against whatever topology the suite targets: standalone under
``invoke standalone-tests`` and cluster under ``invoke cluster-tests`` (the
``_get_client`` helper builds the matching client). HIMPORT was introduced in
Redis 8.9.0, so the whole module is gated on that server version.

Keys use a shared hash tag (``{u}``) so a single test stays within one slot on
cluster; the cross-slot behavior is exercised by a dedicated ``onlycluster`` test.
